# Design Engineering Master's Project – DESE70002 – Module Handbook – 2024/25 (DRAFT)

<div style="display:none;"><strong><a href="https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/Design-Engineering-Masters-Project/">Read this module handbook on GitHub Pages</a></strong></div>
In this last year of your Design Engineering degree, you will engage substantially in a Master’s Project. The project is an opportunity for you to work on a major piece of Design Engineering, by using your acquired knowledge, skills and attitude gained throughout the Master’s programme to bring to fruition a deep-dive project. Your Master’s Project will result in a piece of work with which you will showcase your talent, so as to prepare you for your future professional journey. You should see the project as a chance to produce work that will help you develop your professional network, demonstrate your abilities, and importantly - immerse yourself in a fun, all-encompassing and transformative experience. 
We look forward to seeing your Master’s Projects come to life!
