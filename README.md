In this last year of your Design Engineering degree, you will engage substantially in a Master’s Project. The project is an opportunity for you to work on a major piece of Design Engineering, by using your acquired knowledge, skills and attitude gained throughout the Master’s programme to bring to fruition a deep-dive project. Your Master’s Project will result in a piece of work with which you will showcase your talent, so as to prepare you for your future professional journey. You should see the project as a chance to produce work that will help you develop your professional network, demonstrate your abilities, and importantly - immerse yourself in a fun, all-encompassing and transformative experience.
We look forward to seeing your Master’s Projects come to life!
