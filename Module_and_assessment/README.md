# Module descriptor and assessment brief

The Design Engineering Master's Project is the capstone final year individual project of the degree. It is a major project coursework that will take place over nine months, October to June.

The assessment brief is for you to lead a self-contained project that sits within a wider Design Engineering context, developing a brief and producing a response to your chosen problem using a chosen set of design engineering methodologies and with a focus on bench-marking and validating your response, and positioning it within its wider context.

The summative assessment for the module will take the form of a viva for which you will have prepared a written report, using both modes to communicate to your examiners how your project response has met the assessment criteria detailed below.

There is also formative assessment throughout the year in the form of early and late stage gateways.

## Assessment Criteria
Aligned to the learning outcomes of the module and the programme, and to the assessment brief. Your project will be assessed on the six module learning outcomes, with finer grained assessment criteria within. Each criterion will be graded to whether it meets the passing descriptors and then to what level the excellent descriptors are met.

For each learning outcome, you'll be graded to what level you met the specifications,

| Grade   | Indicative Level                                                                    |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **F**   | Did not meet the passing criteria.                                             |
| **D**   | Marginally did not meet the passing criteria.                                  |
| **C**   | Met the passing specification for the criteria.                                    |
| **B**   | As with **C**, but also **mostly** met the excellent criteria.                 |
| **A**   | As with **C**, but also **fully** met the excellent criteria.                  |
| **A\*** | As with **A**, and exceptionally went above and beyond the excellent criteria. |

Then for the overall assessment, you will receive a grade that is commensurate with the grades for the individual learning outcomes, weighted by the independent assessors as appropriate for the specific nature of the project. The overall grade will be given with + and - modifiers to indicate whether you are in the low (0,1,2) or high (7,8,9) range, but the individual criteria are only specified to letter level.

## Independent Assessment
You will be assessed on your **Project Response** and how it meets the assessment criteria based on a **45 m Viva** for which you will have submitted a 7000 word (±10%) **Project Report**. See [Timetable](../Timetable/README.md) for deadline information.

* **Project Response** – This is the output of the project itself, whether a prototype, a product, experimental data, a research study, etc. There is no need to submit this item through a deliverable, but there will be the opportunity for you to show it and, if applicable, demonstrate its functionalities during the DEMO Day and/or VIVA.
* **Project Report** – A 7000 word (a 10% variation will be considered acceptable) report, to be submitted via Blackboard. Examples of reports from past projects are linked in the Introduction to the Master's Project document, available from Blackboard.
* **Viva** – 15-minute presentation plus 30-minute Q&A, with the 1st and 2nd independent assessors.

The assessment is independent of your supervisor, though they will write a contextualising statement, and is conducted by your two independent assessors. See [details of how these are selected](../Allocation/README.md).

## Early and Late Stage Gateways
There are two formative assessment milestones in this module, the **Early Stage Gateway** (ESG) and **Late Stage Gateway** (LSG). They are conducted at the end of the first and second term respectively and are a check that you are on the right track to meet the assessment criteria of the module for your final submission. The gateways are conducted by your First Independent Assessor, you will receive feedback on the stage of your project and you must pass them in order to continue. There are three levels: Pass, Pass with some concerns, and Not passed - must resubmit.

### Early Stage Gateway
The ESG is at the end of Autumn Term. You will produce a brief report on the context and relevant literature review, with a clear statement of the aims and objectives, as well as a well-structured plan for the work to be done up to the project deadline. Max 2000 words.

You are to arrange to meet with your 1st Assessor in the last week of term 1. In the meeting, you will present the project, the work done so far and the plan ahead, and discuss with the assessor about the current progression.

At this stage, you are expected to have developed on the assessment criteria of the **Contextual Investigation** and have laid groundwork to develop the other assessment criteria in the following term including a short term work plan and longer term objectives.

### Late Stage Gateway
The LSG, at the end of Spring Term, is a brief presentation (max 10 minutes) on the final project goals, together with a schematic plan of works up to the Master's Project deadline. The presentation should contain a brief statement of original goals and the current status, list of tasks/milestones with associated timing.

You will arrange with your 1st Assessor, for a meeting in the last week of term 2.
