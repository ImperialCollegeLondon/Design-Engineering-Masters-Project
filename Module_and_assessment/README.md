# Module descriptor and assessment brief
## Assessment Criteria
### Contextual Investigation
	Analyse and define original insights from research into complex scenarios for design engineering
* **Passing**
	* [ ] The project is defined with some reference to its wider context
	* [ ] A sufficient number of supporting sources are referenced
* **Excellent**
	* [ ] The project is defined with a clear indication of the wider context in which it sits, what approaches have already been taken, and why the approach suggested is appropriate
	* [ ] Insight is shown beyond what has been provided by the project Supervisor
	* [ ] Multiple appropriate sources are properly referenced and reflected upon
### Project Management
	 Manage a significant design engineering project which includes high levels of complexity and uncertainty.
* **Passing**
	* [ ] Evidence of a workplan which has been broadly followed throughout the project.
* **Excellent**
	* [ ] Strong evidence of a workplan, appropriate for the scope, level and timescale, which has been closely followed throughout the year
	* [ ] Strong evidence of well-planned timescales, with appropriate consideration of uncertainty
### Design Engineering Process
	Create an original resolved response to complex challenges by applying a comprehensive set of design engineering tools and methods.
* **Passing**
	* [ ] The approaches (processes and tools) taken in the project are described
* **Excellent**
	* [ ] Approaches are chosen that are appropriate to the task, scope, and timescale. They are well described in how they have been applied and/or executed and there is a discussion as to the suitability of the methods, limitations, and alternatives
### Validation
	Evaluate systems that are complex or ambiguous with appropriate design engineering methods and approaches, assessing their potential social, environmental, technological and economic impact
* **Passing**
	* [ ] Some discussion about how the success of the project has been measured
* **Excellent**
	* [ ] A scheme for evaluating the project has been used, i.e. measures of success and how they are determined. As appropriate, linking to sector standards and benchmarks have been provided
	* [ ] Multiple viewpoints are considered including the project’s success at solving its own problem (or exploring an opportunity) as well as wider impact
### Reflection
	Reflect critically on their own project work in the context of well selected benchmarks and a growth mindset.
* **Passing**
	* [ ] Some discussion about personal skills development during the course of the project
* **Excellent**
	* [ ] Realistic reflection has been carried out about what opportunities the project offered in terms of skills development, how this complemented the student’s existing skills, interests, limitations, and trajectory, in order to represent an appropriate challenge for the student
	* [ ] Clear elements of reflection on the potential impact and implications of the project outcomes to the wider community have been clearly reported/mentioned and discussed
### Communication
	 Synthesise design engineering project outcomes in a range of effective communications materials.
* **Passing**
	* [ ] Report and VIVA broadly communicate what the student did in regard to meeting the other assessment criteria
	* [ ] The student is able to answer to most of the assessors’ questions
* **Excellent**
	* [ ] The report is well structured and written in clear language, engaging and with an appropriate flow. Arguments are well made and presented
	* [ ] The VIVA presentation follows a clear narrative and offers a thorough description of the project output
	* [ ] The student answered to all the questions from the assessors clearly and comprehensively, showing ownership of the project ideas and methods, as well as an excellent understanding of the context
	* [ ] Excellent use of graphics in order to communicate ideas and concept
