# Procedures, regulations, and other relevant matters
Here you'll be able to find relevant information about procedures, regulations and other matters related with the Master's Project.

## Supervision
It is expected that you will regularly meet your project Supervisor during the three terms, in order to discuss the progress of your project on a weekly basis.
This might take the form of individual meetings, and/or research group meetings.
We recommend you agree on the terms of engagement (i.e. meeting frequency and duration, note-keeping, email communications, etc.) with your Supervisor at the beginning of the project.

You can expect 30m per week or 1h per fortnight individual supervision with your supervisor for this module, but it is up to you to drive this meeting schedule.

## AI Policy
Students of the Dyson School of Design Engineering are permitted to make use of generative AI tools for the purposes of completing coursework assignments,
unless specifically prohibited to do so in the relevant assignment brief.

All work submitted must be expressed in students’ own words, incorporating their own ideas and judgements.
Any ideas, text, computer code, images, data, or other resources, generated using generative AI tools,
if included in students’ submissions, must be considered as originating from a third party and must thus be appropriately attributed and cited in line with best academic practice.
Guidance on how to appropriately reference generative AI tools as sources is available from the
[Library](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/library/learning-support/reference-management/vancouver-style/your-reference-list/) (under G for Generative AI).
Further guidance on the use of such tools, and common issues associated with their use, can be found
[here](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/library/learning-support/generative-ai-guidance/).

Failure to properly attribute the origin of 3rd party ideas presented in submitted work, whether from literature or an AI tool,
constitutes plagiarism and will be prosecuted under the College’s
[Academic Misconduct Policy and Procedure](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/administration-and-support-services/registry/academic-governance/public/academic-policy/academic-integrity/Academic-Misconduct-Policy-and-Procedure-v1.3-15.03.23.pdf).
     
Where generative AI tools have been used in the process of generating a document or presentation for the purposes of improving the readability, presentations,
or language of a student’s original work, a notice of which tools were used, and for what purpose, should appear following the list of references.

## Budget
Your Supervisor will administer a budget of £200 for your project. Every purchase has to be approved by your Supervisor in advance.
Claims will be received by depurchasing@imperial.ac.uk, when you submit your final report and, by all means, no later than **30th June 2025** (claims submitted after that date will not be accepted).
To claim expenses, please follow this procedure: 
* [Download and fill in an Expense Claim Form (E1)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/finance/financial-services/expenses/). As 'Activity/Project No' use **NDAA-G47524**, and ask your Supervisor to sign under 'Secondary department authorisation'.
* Send or email the Expense Claim Form (E1) and the original receipts to depurchasing@imperial.ac.uk, with c.c. to your Supervisor.
