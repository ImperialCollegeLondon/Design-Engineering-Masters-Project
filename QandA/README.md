# Q & A

## What are the steps we have to take if we want to do a masters with a company.

A1: In case you have a project idea which involves collaboration with an external industry partner (e.g. the company where you did you Year 3 placement), the first step is to find and contact a suitable Supervisor, as they will need to agree to supervise your project as ‘student-generated’).

An industry partner should be aware that the project will be assessed through reports and presentations by academic first and second markers, as well as reviewed by the project supervisor. If your project involves the use of strategically sensitive data or technologies, or there is potential for new intellectual property, a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) may be necessary. 

Student-partner NDAs are managed by the College, not the School. If this applies to your project, please reach out to Freddie and Andy, and they will help you connect with the appropriate team to handle the NDA process.

## Last year, the students got this presentation during spring term and had access to the project briefs mid-september. How come we didn't get that?** 

The information shared in the kick-off session on 08-October is new and reflects refinements made over the summer. These updates are a direct response to feedback from Project Supervisors and Students at the end of the 2023-24 academic year. 

It’s too soon to brief fully on the module before or during the industry placement.

## If we have an idea that could fall into a tutor generated project brief, but doesn’t perfectly match it, should we bid for it or bid for a student generated project? 

A3: If there is a strong alignment, rank the project and submit an expression of interest for the Academic-generated project. However, if there are any differences, it’s recommended to connect with the Academic to clarify the scope and flexibility of the brief. Together, you can determine whether a new project title and brief should be created.

## Does our idea need to solve a current issue, like for e.g. can it simply just help society in a certain way ? Is that congruent with the mark scheme ?  

A4: In your project, you should aim to address a clearly definable situation. This doesn’t have to be a ‘current issue’; it could be in response to a potential opportunity or an emerging challenge. “Review the assessment criteria in the handbook - if your project brief will allow you to demonstrate meeting these criteria, then your project aligns with expectations. If you remain unsure, discuss the matter with your Project Supervisor or Freddie and / or Andy.

## How involved are our supervisors in our project and what is the extent of their involvement? 

A5: Your Project Supervisor should offer feedback and guidance throughout the project. However, you are responsible for directing the project on a day-to-day basis, not the Supervisor.  

You should aim to meet with your Supervisor up to once a week, although there may be times when meetings are skipped or postponed. It’s recommended not to go more than two or three weeks without checking in. 

Your Project Supervisor will also provide context on the quality of your work to the first Assessor, supporting the summative assessment process. 

You can expect 30m per week, or 1h per fortnight individually as a baseline for supervision.

## Can I do something that aligns with ERO and my electives, how would self plagiarism work and how much work/research can be transferable  

A6: Your Masters project must be a standalone, original piece of work to meet academic conduct requirements. Only work conducted specifically as part of the Masters project will be considered for assessment. You may reference data or findings from other College-related assignments, but these should be cited appropriately, just as you would with any third-party source. 

You cannot submit for credit in one module work that has been submitted for credit in another. Make sure that the Master’s project is a self-contained response.

## Are some of the projects that have descriptions student proposed ones? 

A7: Projects submitted that have been marked as student proposed haven’t been included in the project list on Blackboard. The projects submitted by colleagues linked to a student are kept internally. 

The listed projects have been developed by the School’s Academics, with some initiated in collaboration with academic, institutional, or industry partners.

## Will our supervisor have any impact in our grade? 

A8:  Your Project Supervisor is not responsible for summative assessment of your project work. However, they play a crucial role in your success by guiding you through the project and providing regular feedback. Additionally, Project Supervisors nominate and provide context on the quality of your work to the first Assessor, contributing to the summative assessment process.

## Is report evaluated along the viva? As in is it read before or not 

A9: Your project report is submitted up to two weeks before the Viva. Assessors will review your report in preparation for the Viva. Both your report and Viva are assessed using the single rubric provided in the handbook.

## Say you want to propose a project related to a specific area?

A10: Review staff profiles to learn about their experience and research interests. Additionally, browse the published list of projects to identify potential Supervisors who have relevant expertise in your area of interest.  

## What’s the rules on using AI ?  

A11: **School Policy is:** Students of the Dyson School of Design Engineering are permitted to make use of generative AI tools for the purposes of completing coursework assignments, unless specifically prohibited to do so in the relevant assignment brief.

All work submitted must be expressed in students’ own words, incorporating their own ideas and judgements. Any ideas, text, computer code, images, data, or other resources, generated using generative AI tools, if included in students’ submissions, must be considered as originating from a third party and must thus be appropriately attributed and cited in line with best academic practice. Guidance on how to appropriately reference generative AI tools as sources is available from the [Library](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/library/learning-support/reference-management/vancouver-style/your-reference-list/) (under G for Generative AI). Further guidance on use of such tools, and common issues associated with their use, can be found [here](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/library/learning-support/generative-ai-guidance/).

Failure to properly attribute the origin of 3rd party ideas presented in submitted work, whether from literature or an AI tool, constitutes plagiarism and will be prosecuted under the College’s [Academic Misconduct Policy and Procedure](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/administration-and-support-services/registry/academic-governance/public/academic-policy/academic-integrity/Academic-Misconduct-Policy-and-Procedure-v1.3-15.03.23.pdf).
     
Where generative AI tools have been utilised in the process of generating a document or presentation for the purposes of improving the readability, presentations, or language of a student’s original work, a notice of which tools were used, and for what purpose, should appear following the list of references.

**Summary:**
You must also be able to stand by the content of your submission. It is you who is writing the report on your response to your brief, and who will be viva examined on its content. Be cautious in uncritically accepting suggestions from a system that cannot [tell you how many Rs in the word strawberry](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7pQrMAekdn4).

## What’s the weighting Report/Viva? 

A12: The Report and Viva are the modes by which you demonstrate your meeting of the assessment criteria. There is no individual mark for either component individually, only for the project response as a single item, as evidenced by the report and viva. 

The report and viva themselves are observed in the Communication learning outcome.

## When do we get to know who our assessors are? 

A13: We aim to do this within one week of projects being allocated.

## When do we need to select our Superviser by ? Is it first come first served ?  

A14: It’s not first come first served. All allocations will be made after student and staff rankings are in. Use [this form](https://forms.office.com/e/YtkXB7Lht6) to submit your project preferences, in rank order, by Tuesday 15 October 2024, 14:00 ([see Timetable](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/Design-Engineering-Masters-Project/Timetable/)) 

We recommend you rank 5 or 6 projects although you can rank up to 10. After the Student Rankings closes, Supervisors will be able to see which students chose their projects and rank them in order of preference.  

The module leads will then run an [automatic program](https://youtu.be/Qcv1IqHWAzg?si=izBvfuyp2lU3_-iG) to match Supervisors with students. We have had very good success with this in previous years.

## What happens if we have issues with our supervisor 

A15: If you are unable to resolve issues with your Supervisor, please reach out to Freddie and/or Andy, and we will help mediate a resolution

## To what extent do we have to go to explain the say basic technical details involved in the project, assuming the second assessor may not be a field expert 

A16: This is likely to vary from one project to another and so we recommend you seek guidance from your Project Supervisor. 

You should be able to go deeply into the detail you have been working on. But the context and positioning should be accessible to an academic reader not from the domain.

## If you are planning on doing a student-generated project (your own Project Brief): 1.  Do you have to bid for tutors or can you also just agree with them ?  2. Who should you talk to about scope? 

A17.1: For a self-generated project, you must find a Project Supervisor who is willing to oversee your work. 

You and they rank projects in the same way as academic generated projects. There’s no obligation for either party to put this at the top of the list. 

A17.2: Scope your self-generated project concepts with potential Project Supervisors: i.e. discuss the scope of work with Academics, who have domain expertise relevant to your concept.

## How does the allocation work if a supervisor has agreed to have me for one of the proposed ideas 

A18: After the Student Rankings closes (Tuesday 15 October 2024, 14:00), Supervisors will be able to see which students chose their projects and rank them in order of preference. The module leads will then run an automatic program to match Supervisors with students. We have had very good success with this in previous years. 

If you are in the supervisor’s top choices within their capacity and the project is your top rank, you will be matched together.
