# You Said, We Did â€“ Changes from last year
In response to student feedback and to improve the module, the following changes have been made from last year.
## 2024/25
* New streamlined [module handbook](../).
* Assessment Criteria descriptors have been redefined to be easier to observe meeting.
* Supervisors now will provide context to independent assessors as to how the project fits with each of the assessment criteria.
* Supervisors no longer mark projects.
* Both Independent Assessors will be assigned at the beginning of the module.
* Final viva will be booked at the beginning of the module.
* Early stage and late stage gateways no longer have their own assessment criteria, instead they review that the project is on track to meet the final assessment criteria.
## 2023/24
* Project/supervisor allocations:
	* Students are informed about how the project selection/allocation is run in the Spring Term, before the DE3 Placement, in order for them to be prepared about what's to come and to be able to start thinking about potential supervisors/projects (including industry ones during the placement).
	* Project ideas from staff are collected in mid September, and students are given access to the allocation portal at the beginning of W1 (first Monday, via email)
	* At the end of W2 and/or beginning of W1, two hours for each academic are allocated to meeting DE4 students, with a room booked for this.
	* Shortlisting and ranking from staff and students to be completed by end of W2, and allocation published by mid W3.
 
* Late Stage Gateway:
	* Late Stage Gateway to become a compulsory presentation with the independent assessor, with Q&A and verbal feedback.
	* Requirements and aims of the Late Stage Gateway to be better clarified in the module documentation.

* Other changes:
	* Offer additional support about how to write a report (this will be done in collaboration with the Centre for Academic English)
	* Encourage students to start their work from the first weeks of the Autumn Term (this will be done by each supervisor)
